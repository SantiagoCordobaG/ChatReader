# ChatLume (Formerly Obsidian) - WhatsApp Chat Viewer

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

ChatLume (Formerly Obsidian) is a privacy-first WhatsApp export viewer.
It parses exported `.txt` files (or `.zip` files that contain a `.txt`) directly in your browser and renders a WhatsApp-like chat UI with search, analytics, and inline media support.

## Attribution

This repository is a derivative work of [ChatLume](https://github.com/ParasSharma2306/ChatLume), originally created by Paras Sharma.

Changes in this fork may include custom UI, parser updates, and feature additions specific to this version.

## Privacy

- All parsing is local in the browser.
- No server upload is required.
- Your chat file never leaves your machine unless you choose to host/modify the app yourself.
- **PWA Enabled**: Install ChatLume to your device and use it fully offline with no internet connection required.

## Current Features

- Import WhatsApp exports from `.txt` and `.zip`.
- Robust line parser with multiline message continuation support, including date separators like `/`, `-`, and `.`.
- Message list rendering with grouped bubbles and date separators.
- Inline rendering for images, stickers, videos, audio, and downloadable documents from ZIP exports.
- Lazy loading for inline images and video so large chats stay smoother.
- Real-time message search with highlight and up/down navigation.
- Jump-to-date action from the header menu.
- Analytics drawer for total message count, media count, and sender distribution.
- Dark/light theme toggle.
- Loading overlay and disabled actions while parsing to prevent accidental double loads.
- Responsive desktop/mobile layout.

## Limitations

- Missing attachments are shown clearly when the export references a file that is not present in the ZIP.
- Date-jump accuracy depends on date markers and locale format in the export.
- Very uncommon localized export phrases may still need additional parser rules.
- Extremely large exports can still take time to parse because everything is processed locally in-browser.

## Quick Start

1. Export a chat from WhatsApp.
2. Choose `Without Media` for faster parsing (recommended).
3. Open this project and load `index.html` in a browser.
4. Enter your display name exactly as it appears in the chat export.
5. Upload the `.txt` or `.zip` and click `Load Chat`.

## Local Development

This project has no build step.

Option A: open `index.html` directly.

Option B: serve statically (recommended for consistent browser behavior):

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
- CSS3
- [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) for `.zip` parsing
- [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)

## Notes

- User-generated message content is HTML-escaped before rendering.
- External links are opened with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Search query regex is escaped to prevent invalid regex crashes.
- Menu interactions and date-jump fallbacks handle older browser behavior.
- German exports using dates like `01.04.26` and attachment labels like `Datei angehängt` are supported.

## Community Credit

- German export parsing and attachment-label feedback came from Reddit user `u/jacckyryan`.
